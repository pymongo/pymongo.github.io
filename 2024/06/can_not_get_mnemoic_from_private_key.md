You're correct that it's generally straightforward to derive a private key from a mnemonic phrase, but the reverse process (deriving a mnemonic from a private key) is not typically possible or standardized. Here's why:

1. Mnemonic to Private Key:
   - This is a one-way process defined by standards like BIP39 (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39).
   - The mnemonic phrase contains more information than just the private key. It includes a checksum and potentially additional metadata.
   - The process involves:
     1. Converting the mnemonic words to a binary seed.
     2. Using this seed to generate the master private key.
     3. Deriving child keys if needed (for HD wallets).

2. Private Key to Mnemonic:
   - This is not standardly possible because:
     - The private key doesn't contain the additional information present in the mnemonic (like the checksum).
     - Multiple different mnemonics could potentially generate the same private key.
     - The mnemonic creation process involves randomness that isn't captured in the private key alone.

For the cryptocurrencies you mentioned (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Cosmos, Solana):

- Ethereum: As you showed, libraries like `eth_account` can derive keys from mnemonics but not vice versa.
- Bitcoin: Libraries like `bitcoinlib` work similarly.
- Cosmos: The `cosmos-sdk` follows the same principle.
- Solana: Tools like `@solana/web3.js` also derive keys from mnemonics but not the reverse.

In practice, if you need to "recover" a mnemonic-like representation from a private key, you would typically:
1. Generate a new mnemonic.
2. Derive its corresponding private key.
3. Replace this derived private key with your actual private key.

This creates a new, valid mnemonic-private key pair, but it's not recovering the original mnemonic. It's creating a new one that happens to produce the same private key.

Remember, for security reasons, it's generally recommended to start with a mnemonic and derive keys from it, rather than starting with raw private keys.
