# [memrise 学日语](/2023/06/learn_japanese_by_memrise_app.md)

19 年我还在日企的时候，看了某文推荐的 memrise 破解版学日语，印象很深的是很多日本人实拍的口语对话短视频，就像抖音那样一个个划过的短视频不断学习和复习句型语法单词，有个日本大叔在街头满头大汗说天气很热的短视频让我印象很深，至今还记得日语热的形容词

> any language learning app like memrise?

memrise 的日语课程有 N3-N5 水平，但是英语课程就过于简单只有小学水平

最近电子阳痿云原神也准备卸载了，想着坐地铁或者吃饭时不玩游戏刷几个单词的短视频也好(想起另一个也在学英语的同事，还把今年高考英语题也做了下)

```
