游泳最讨厌的是刚下水接触 26 度凉水身体的失温感，最喜欢的是游泳后在温泉酒店的游泳馆里泡温泉

为了促进大脑血液循环温泉内，我想着潜入水底，但发现很容易就浮起来

于是发问道，是不是热水中浮力更强在冷水池中还是挺容易下潜的

> does hot water more buoyancy than cold water

Yes, hot water has less density and more buoyancy than cold water.

The density of water varies with temperature, where warmer water is less dense than cooler water. This is because when water is heated, the molecules move faster and become more spread out, resulting in a decrease in density. Conversely, when water is cooled, the molecules slow down and come closer together, leading to an increase in density.

Since buoyancy is a measure of the upward force exerted on an object immersed in fluid (such as water), it depends on the density of the fluid. Therefore, warmer water will have more buoyancy than cooler water, all other factors being equal.

This effect can be observed in many real-world situations. For example, swimmers often find it easier to float in warm water compared to cold water...

但 gpt 这个回答有些前后矛盾，明明冷水密度更大，同等体积下排开水的质量更大，理应更大浮力

冷水池中水深较深，蛙泳容易调整出下倾角度下潜到 2 米水底，而温泉水太浅较难实现

> but cold water more density should easier float than warm water

```
You are correct that cold water is more dense than warm water and therefore it should be easier to float in cold water. I apologize for my mistake in the previous response.

题外话: 游泳的风险

有野外河水湖泊游泳的人因鼻腔进水且水质脏有食脑虫导致死亡，解决办法就不要在脏水的野外游泳且鼻腔尽量不要进水
